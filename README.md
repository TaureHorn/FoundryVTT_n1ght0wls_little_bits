# n1ght0wls_little_bits
A small collection of changes to FoundryVTT that are best defined in a module, but are themeselves too small to make a specific module for.

E.g. making the FilePickers default view set to thumbnails is a single line of code that executes on game launch, aint nobody need a full module for that, and I don't need a full module that overhauls the file picker
